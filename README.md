Welcome to our Laravel e-commerce site! This project is a fully-featured e-commerce platform built using the Laravel framework, with a clean and modular codebase.

One of the key features of this site is the admin panel, which allows for easy management of products, orders, and customers. Additionally, the site includes a real-time notification system, which keeps all users updated on the status of their orders in real-time. The email system is also fully integrated and allows for automated communication with customers.

The front-end of the site has been built using Vue.js, which allows for smooth and efficient user interactions. We have also made sure that the codebase is clean and easy to navigate, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.

We hope you enjoy using our Laravel e-commerce site, and we welcome any feedback or contributions.
